## The Purpose

We wanted to create a user-friendly simulator of *Biological System*. The main points were:

+ Most of the programms found on the Web provide no interface for ordinary user. You are working with raw data and the image is not visible.

+ Due to the graphics it's more comfortable to analyze the *Biological System*.
